            <p>A C99 compiler I wrote, in C.</p>
            <p>It currently supports all the basic language constructs: conditionals, loops, expressions, arrays, pointers, function calls.</p>
            <p>It uses recursive descent to build an AST. The AST is translated to an intermediate language, then converted into assembly via macro expansion and register allocation with graph coloring.</p>
